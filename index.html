                The 2008 Volkswagen R32 was a limited production vehicle based on the MK5 Golf platform.
                The R32 shares a lot of similarities with it's siblings when it comes to comfort and
                entertainment. At a glance this looks like a regular Golf or GTI but all the differences
                are under the hood and chassis. Production was limited for the R32 to just 5000 in the USA.
                Other countries also had limited production and seemingly unique to the USA is a 4-door
                version was never produced.

                Volkswagen Engineers managed to stuff the 3.2L VR6 performance engine under the hood. The
                engine is transverse mounted, meaning the "front" of the engine is at the right side of
                the vehicle. The 3.2L 24 valve VR6 engine produces 250 HP at 6,250 RPM and 236 lb. ft. of
                torque at 3,000 RPM. With some modifications the engine power can be increased to around
                275HP, and many have added forced induction producing well around 500 HP.

            <p>
                The power of the R32 is handled by a DSG DQ250 6-Speed Automatic Transmission coupled with a
                Haldex 4 AWD system and is where all similarities of it's siblings ends.
                The Haldex 4 (AKA: 4-Motion) intelligent all wheel drive system can provide up to 90% of the power
                to the rear wheels making drifting possible. Even with 4 inches of fresh snow
                on the road this car will propel itself to 40MPH in under 7 seconds.
            </p>
            <h1 id="performance" class="mHeads">Performance</h1>
                The R32 is a blast rocketing to 60 MPH in under 6 seconds completing the 1/4 mile
                in under 14.5 seconds. Due to the added weight of the VR6 engine and AWD system
                Volkswagen Engineers mounted the suspension 10mm higher in the
                chassis than it's GTI and Golf/Rabbit siblings giving it a lower center of gravity
                and stance.

                The R32 has many styling cues that differ from its siblings, the GTI and Golf/Rabbit.
                The most notable is the R32 badge on the exterior. The interior is unique where each
                R32 produced includes the serial number on the steering wheel.
